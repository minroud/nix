# About Nix
At the moment, Nix is but a draft.
Once developed, it will simulate a simplified mobile phone OS as part of a escaperoom-like experience.
Stay tuned for more!

# Underlying Tech
Nix is a hybrid mobile app written in TypeScript using React and compiled with Capacitor.
It uses Ionic as a UI library.

## Why hybrid?
It suits Nix's performance needs, speeds up development and allows us to support both Android and iOS

## Why not use ReactNative?
We perceive no need for native performance & Ionic/Capacitor offer a truly cross-platform solution

## Why not use standard Ionic + Angular
Ionic 4 has brought new ideas. It's becoming more of a mobile UI library, which gives more freedom to the developers. 
Angular is great, but it sometimes overcomplicates things and enforces an OO approach.
When coupling React with Typescript is easier to adopt a more functional approach, which is something we wanted to explore.

# Can I help?
Sure! Just ping us & let us know your ideas.

# Can I copy it?
Well, you certainly can.
But cool people don't copy.
Cool people create.
And you are cool, right?
